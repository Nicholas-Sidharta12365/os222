# LINKS

## Week 1
1. [devhints - Bash CheatSheet](https://devhints.io/bash)<br>
    This link helped me a lot as a beginner on linux, especially to know all these weird and janky syntaxes that linux uses called Bash and what each everyone of them do is quite the challenge.
2. [ideone](https://ideone.com/)<br>
    The one very helpful link I come to everytime I wanted to test out bash commands (or any other programming language :/). This online compiler lets me experiment and try different and wacky bash commands and combinations that I am afraid to try on my local system with ZERO RISKS.
3. [Regex CheatSheet](https://www.rexegg.com/regex-quickstart.html)<br>
    A link that I found very useful in finding out more about Regex and very easy to understand in my opinion as a beginner on regex itself. Complete with examples and samples.
4. [Regex FunFacts](https://www.rexegg.com/regex-vs-regular-expression.html)<br>
    Just a little link I found while searching around the internet for regex cheatsheets but found out that this link is very interesting and pretty informative. The content of the webpage is about Regex vs Regex (Regular Expression) and a short history about Regex itself.
5. [VIM - CheatSheet](https://vim.rtorr.com/)<br>
    The first week of OS class got me interested in VIM since it was introduced, although not a lot. VIM itself is a very interesting editor and with it comes a great utilities that come in the form of weird commands, thus this cheatsheet really did help me in introducing for the first time what VIM is capable of.
6. [Grep Vs Sed Vs Awk](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/differences-between-grep-sed-awk/)<br>
    Another little link I found while scavenging for OS 222 materials for week 1. This link is very helpful if you want to know the differences of grep, sed, and awk. The link itself is a documentation but I found it pretty easy to understand complete with examples and easy to understand explanations.
<br>

## Week 2
1. [Private Vs Public Key - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-private-key-and-public-key/)
A very useful link for me since I was really interested in public and private keys and how they work. Definitely recommended to those who still don't understand the main difference of those two, really easy to understand and simple.
2. [The C Programming Language Second Edition](http://cslabcms.nju.edu.cn/problem_solving/images/c/cc/The_C_Programming_Language_%282nd_Edition_Ritchie_Kernighan%29.pdf)
An insanely complete book about everything you need to know about the C programming language. From the basics to the complex concepts, complete with examples and easy to understand explanations. Recommended for anyone who wants to learn about the C programming language, it really helped me a lot on understanding the concepts of Memory Addressing, Memory Allocations, strings(char*) in C, as well as printf formatings.
3. [Principle of least privilege](https://delinea.com/what-is/least-privilege)
A very detailed and informative webpage that explains the concept of principle of least privilege in computer and computer network security. I found this term on this week's slide and got really curious about it, the webpage might be quite devastating at first but honestly it is an amusing explanation complete with images to show how it works.

## Week 3
1. [Bind command in Linux](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bind-command-in-linux-with-examples/#:~:text=bind%20command%20is%20Bash%20shell,being%20pressed%20on%20the%20keyboard.)
A website that teaches me a lot about linux's bind command. I got interested in learning this since this could help me save a lot of time instead of typing something over and over again especially if a bash line is considered long. I recommended this since I believe it is very complete and very easy to understand, highly recommended.
2. [File Management - Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/file-management-in-linux/)
A website that explains common file management commands on linux, complete with explanations, examples, and demos. Personally, I think this website is really useful, informative, and really easy to understand.
3. [File Management Commands](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/unix-file-management.htm)
An addition from the link above, this web explains in more detail about file management as well as providing more examples of file management commands on Unix/Linux. It is complete with easy to understand explanation and examples. Highly recommended.
