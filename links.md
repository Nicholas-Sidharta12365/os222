# LINKS

## Week 1
1. [devhints - Bash CheatSheet](https://devhints.io/bash)<br>
    This link helped me a lot as a beginner on linux, especially to know all these weird and janky syntaxes that linux uses called Bash and what each everyone of them do is quite the challenge.
2. [ideone](https://ideone.com/)<br>
    The one very helpful link I come to everytime I wanted to test out bash commands (or any other programming language :/). This online compiler lets me experiment and try different and wacky bash commands and combinations that I am afraid to try on my local system with ZERO RISKS.
3. [Regex CheatSheet](https://www.rexegg.com/regex-quickstart.html)<br>
    A link that I found very useful in finding out more about Regex and very easy to understand in my opinion as a beginner on regex itself. Complete with examples and samples.
4. [Regex FunFacts](https://www.rexegg.com/regex-vs-regular-expression.html)<br>
    Just a little link I found while searching around the internet for regex cheatsheets but found out that this link is very interesting and pretty informative. The content of the webpage is about Regex vs Regex (Regular Expression) and a short history about Regex itself.
5. [VIM - CheatSheet](https://vim.rtorr.com/)<br>
    The first week of OS class got me interested in VIM since it was introduced, although not a lot. VIM itself is a very interesting editor and with it comes a great utilities that come in the form of weird commands, thus this cheatsheet really did help me in introducing for the first time what VIM is capable of.
6. [Grep Vs Sed Vs Awk](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/differences-between-grep-sed-awk/)<br>
    Another little link I found while scavenging for OS 222 materials for week 1. This link is very helpful if you want to know the differences of grep, sed, and awk. The link itself is a documentation but I found it pretty easy to understand complete with examples and easy to understand explanations.
